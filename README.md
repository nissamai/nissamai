I'm a senior software engineer with almost 10 years of experience building data and web tools that improve access to public resources.

I've also got superb management skills, and I'm trying to make the world a better place.

## Software Engineering Leadership

My approach to software engineering leadership draws from my experiences as a volunteer community organizer. I discovered my love of community organizing in high school youth group, and I've been helping teams of people collaborate effectively to achieve shared goals ever since. I want to empower teams I work with to identify + communicate the scope of the problem they're trying to solve, help identify what's needed to solve the problem, unblock, and get out of the way.

## Actual Software Engineering

My approach to software engineering is a little harder to summarize, but I basically try to make sure I'm solving the right problem (both immediately and existentially, if we're being honest). Then prioritize all the possible risks and issues. Then identify and map out the tools. Then start trying things, iteratively. AI could have written that summary for all you know, so I guess you'll have to give me an example problem to see how I'd actually figure it out.

## What do you mean, a better place?

There are so many people on the planet! I'd like to see a world where more of us have a chance to work out the best versions of ourselves and contribute to our communities in ways that feel meaningful to us.

To that effect, I want a world where everyone has access to basic needs like healthcare, housing, education, food, and human connection. I want people to have opportunities to sharpen skills that feel synchronous with our personalities and strengths. I want to ensure equal opportunities regardless of background and address harm through tools like restorative justice.

Software engineering probably isn't going to build that world, but it's a nice tool.
